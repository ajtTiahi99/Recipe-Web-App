## About The Project

  
I started this project by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. This app is built with the purpose to connect various users just like any social media app. The users can search for various recipes using the search feature which uses Edamam API to filter recipes from thousands available in the database.
Here only the authenticated users can share the recipes by creating a post for their recipes, like and save other user's posts and delete their recipe post, edit profile contents. 
For storing the pictures of users I have used Firebase Storage because MongoDB is not really suitable for image storage. However, there is still a lot of scope for improvement in the project such as adding features like delete, share post, view other user's profile, comment etc.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, JSX, CSS, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and Firebase and axios.
