## Reflection

  
I started this project by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. This is app is build with the purpose to connect various users just a social media app. Here only the authenticated users can share the recipes by creating a post, can like a post, save and delete a recipe post, edit profile contents. They can also search various recipes using search feature which uses Edamam API to filter recipes from thousands available in the database. For Storing the pictures of users I have used Firebase because MongoDB is not really suitable for image storage.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, JSX, CSS, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and Firebase.
